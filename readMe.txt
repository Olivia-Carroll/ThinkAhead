ThinkAhead:
    The project is a personalized task manager and calendar designed to help 
    students, specifically Neurodivergent students, manage their academic and
    personal responsibilities in a more organized and efficient way. Modeled for
    my little brother, the system includes a working calendar, focus aid, 
    break creator, and many other focus aids to help users achieve their goals 
    and stay on task. The task manager also features several APIs and programs 
    that offer mathematical, language, and scientific converters, as well as a 
    quick search option for locating books, places, and items near the 
    user's current location.

    One of the key features of the task manager is the AI-implemented alerts 
    system, which effectively detects assignments or events that are typically 
    turned in late or forgotten about. These alerts serve as reminders to the 
    user, informing them when a deadline is approaching that they might miss. 
    Additionally, the task manager includes class aids such as a calculator, 
    dictionary, and more.

    The break tools provided by the task manager are designed to help users 
    stay healthy and safe. Users can search for fun places to visit during 
    longer breaks, use focused breathing tools to match their breath, and even
    draw in a drawing app. With focus tasks, users can set a timer as well as 
    breaks and study for classes.

    Overall, this personalized task manager and calendar is an innovative and 
    comprehensive tool that is specifically designed to meet the unique needs 
    of Neurodivergent students. It offers a reliable and efficient way for 
    them to manage their academic responsibilities while promoting a sense 
    of independence and self-reliance.
